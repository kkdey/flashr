Description: Fits low-rank matrix and tensor mean models using
             non-parametric unimodal priors on the components.
             For fitting a rank-1 matrix or tensor mean model,
             flashr will run a variational expectation-maximization
             (VEM) algorithm where the componenets and variances are
             assumed to be separable. For higher-ranks, a greedy algorithm
             is available where the VEM algorithm is iteratively run on the
             residuals of the previous iteration. A backfitting procedure
             is available for refined estimation.
