# flashr

Repo for flashr R package: Factor Loading Adaptive SHrinkage for matrix and tensor data.

# Installation
To install dependencies, run in R:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("irlba", "tensr"))
devtools::install_github("stephens999/ashr", ref = "uni")
```
The "uni" branch of the ashr package is required to use any mixing distribution other than a normal.

Because this is currently a private repo, to install flashr you will need a private access token (PAT) which you can generate here: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Then you can run in R: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install_github("stephenslab/flashr", auth_token = "xxx")
```
where you replace `xxx` with your PAT.
